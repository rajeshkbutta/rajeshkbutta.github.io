Hello, thank you for visiting my website. I am excited to tell you about myself and what I am working on.

I am an AI/ML engineer with a background that bridges medicine, computer science, and artificial intelligence. With a Bachelor's in Computer Science (cum laude) and a minor in Chemistry, I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with an AI specialization at the University of South Florida, set to graduate in May 2025. Before fully transitioning to AI, I spent three years in medical school, where I gained deep insights into human biology and healthcare—perspectives that now fuel my passion for building intelligent systems with real-world impact.

My work centers on developing AI/ML solutions that amplify human capabilities, solve complex problems, and push the boundaries of what’s possible. I have expertise in NLP, MLOps, and large-scale AI applications, working with frameworks such as AWS SageMaker, Hugging Face (Mistral-4B, LLaMa-1B), Docker, Kubernetes, and Apache Kafka. Some of my key projects include:

  - **Toxicity AI** – An AI model leveraging Mistral-4B to predict drug toxicity from physician reports, achieving 70% accuracy.
  - **OrgoVR** – A mobile AR application designed to revolutionize organic chemistry education.
  - **MulticulturalED** – An AI-powered initiative for inclusive and adaptive learning.
  - **Multimodal AI Model** – Currently developing a system that integrates image and text modalities for unified content generation.

Beyond technical expertise, I have a strong leadership background—serving as Treasurer of the Neurosurgery Club at Midwestern University, Secretary of the Engineering Medical Society at USF (where I increased membership by 150%), and leading teams in competitive settings like the Tampa Cricket League.

My long-term vision is to merge AI with quantum computing, redefining the human paradigm through next-generation intelligent systems. For me, AI isn’t just about automation—it’s about augmentation, enhancing our ability to think, create, and discover.

When I’m not building AI models, you can find me in the gym, working on my own optimization—both mentally and physically.

**Let’s build the future, one algorithm at a time.**
